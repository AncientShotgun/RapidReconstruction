# Rapid Reconstruction
**For when you need to repair that Arc Furnace Electrode quickly.**

For Minecraft version 1.12.2

Mod Version 1.0.2

Rapid Reconstruction is a Minecraft mod aimed at providing an alternate method of repairing armor, tools, weapons or anything with durability in as balanced a way as possible.

This mod adds three tiers of Reconstruction Amulet items which, when used with whatever your 'use' key is bound to (defaults to right-click) in your main hand, will scan your inventory for the first damaged item it comes across and repair it, consuming its own durability in the process. If you use the Reconstruction Amulet in your off hand, the repair effect will isolate itself to the item in your main hand. In both cases, the repair will only occur if the item is under a certain durability, which differs for each of the three tiers and can be adjusted in the config.

Reconstruction Amulets cannot repair themselves or other Reconstruction Amulets.

This mod is balanced against Vanilla Minecraft, as other mods may change the game in such a way that balancing this mod against them is impossible.
